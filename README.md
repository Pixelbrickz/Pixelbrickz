byi                                                                                                                                                                                         
I have social anxiety & im mentally unwell, i might say and do things causally that could be deemed concerning.                                                                            
please tell me if your ever bothered, im a MASSIVE people pleaser.

im a huge introvert.  
and will likely get tired of a conversation after a while if we aren't well acquainted, i have a low social battery.                                                                      
i might sound nervous, distant, or dry if we're never met, im unsure to approuch people i dont know! [you intimidate me : ( ]                                                             
i can be very talkative or jst go completely silent mid conversation, i usually get alot more comfortable after a few simple exchanges of words tho.
sometimes i need clarification as i tend to overthink or misinterpret what is said to me. always iwc if we've never met please.                                                           
if you have c+h in your name i might sit near you but probably not talk unless you do or i feel like i would like to!
