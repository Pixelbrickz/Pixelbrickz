I have social anxiety & im mentally unwell, i might say and do things causally that could be deemed concerning.                                                                            
please tell me if your ever bothered by me, im a MASSIVE people pleaser i would like every1 to be comfortable! 

im a huge introvert.  
and will likely get tired of a conversation after a while if we aren't well acquainted, i have a low social battery.                                                                      
i might sound nervous, distant, or dry if we're never met, im unsure to approuch people i dont know! [you intimidate me : ( ]                                                             
i can be very talkative or jst go completely silent mid conversation, again,,, forgive me                                                                                    
sometimes i need clarification as i tend to overthink or misinterpret what is said to me. always iwc if we've never met please.
