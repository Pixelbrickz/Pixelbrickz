**if we arent close how i talk to you/my thoughts on you can sometimes not reflect my mood or true feelings, i am emotionally numb as a way to cope w/trauma.**                           
**please bare with me im trying my best. ^_^**

im a huge introvert,  
i can be very talkative or jst go completely silent mid conversation,, forgive me                                                                                                        
i am an empath and also happen to be a HPS *(highly sensitive person)* strong emotions do accumulate & bother me :(.                                               
*mild fear of people, if we haven't met i might just be mute, i swear tho i would love to talk 2 u ^_^!! just give me time to warm up :)*

sometimes i need clarification as i tend to overthink or misinterpret what is said to me. always iw/care if we've never met pls
