I get irritated if im alone for a long time which can make me sound dry or uninterested in talking to u if we haven't met. but i promise its not ur fault!!


if im oversimulated I'll be very hyperactive and my spelling will likely get messy im sorry


i can read most grammar easily so typing quirks are fine to use while talking to me ^_^
(most of this has been moved to my strawpage!!)
