byi                                                                                                                                                                                         
I have social anxiety & im mentally unwell, i might say and do things causally that could be deemed concerning.                                                                            
please tell me if your ever bothered, im a MASSIVE people pleaser.

im a huge introvert.                                                                                                                                                                      
i might sound nervous, distant, or dry if we're never met, im unsure to approuch people i dont know! [you intimidate me : ( ] 
i can be very talkative or jst go completely silent mid conversation, i usually get alot more comfortable after a few simple exchanges of words tho.
sometimes i need clarification as i tend to overthink or misinterpret what is said to me. always iwc if we've never met please.
if you have c+h in your name i might sit near you but probably not talk unless you do or i feel like i would like to! 

i can normally keep a conversation once its an interest i enjoy but if not i'll usually jst get quiet, im unsure what to say.
im usually alot more interactive and happy near my friends so if we're new friends be aware>>!
